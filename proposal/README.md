# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Yale Ims Webpage

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A revamp of the Yale IMs webpage that is more user-friendly and interactive

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our project aims to consolidate everything related to IMs in a new and improved Yale IMs webpage. IM participants can see the IM schedule on
an interactive calendar (using an API), see the college standings overall and in individual sports (in a chart with SQL, and perhaps even
with graphs for data visualization), see the shuttle times and the differente routes (HTML/JavaScript), see an interactive photo compilation
that IM sec's can update by logging in (using an API), sign-up for panlists of different sports (SQL database), and find appropriate captains
for particular sport + college (HTML/JavaScript/SQL). Moreover, there will be an interactive announcements page that IM sec's can update.
If we have time, we can incorporate a real-time shuttle map.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Bare bones of webpage:
College standings in simple table format
Announcements listed on separate page
IM Secretaries login/logout to update college standings + announcements
Static stock photos related to IMs
Calendar as a table (manually updated through SQL)
Form to get onto panlist (sport, college)
List out captains’ email (according to sport, college) without Navigation Bar
List of shuttle times


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Incorporate API features (for calendar and photo compilation)
Form to obtain captains’ email (sport, college) + being able to update captain yearly through front-end by IM secretary


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Incorporate AJAX for announcements (get more announcements as you scroll)
being able to update captains yearly front-end
Real-time shuttle schedule with interactive shuttle map
Have 14 separate pages for each residential college with college-specific information: photo slideshow

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We divided the work between 3 people. Amy will be responsible for the table that has all the captains' emails and the announcements page.
Selena is responsible for figuring out how to use API (calendar and photo slideshow) — or, if that falls through,making relevant tables and
integrating photos manually — listing shuttle times, creating a login for IM secretaries, and reorganizing the layout/distribution of
information on the current IMs website. Rebecca is responsible for the college standings table and the panlist table / signup to be on a
particular panlist. If I want to make the announcements interactive, I need to get more familiar with AJAX.
