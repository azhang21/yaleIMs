# Preproposal

## We [Selena Lee and Amy Zhang] wrote this preproposal together on a google doc, and we copied/pasted from there. [update: A third person joined on after we wrote the preproposal.]

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. Revamp Yale IMs page by integrating multiple components together using HTML, CSS, Python, Jinja, Bootstrap, and/or JavaScript:
a. Spreadsheet of college standings - split into two parts: for captains (back-end that can be updated via google spreadsheets), participants (front-end that can be viewed and sorted by the user on the website)
b. Shuttle website - DoubleMap (integrate map into a page on the IMs website)
c. Panlist sign-ups (to get reminder emails about particular sport)
d. Interactive photo compilation (to see what each sport looks like)
e. Announcements that can be easily/frequently updated on frontpage
f. Incorporate a Chrome extension that would create a popup of rules/score sheet instead of redirecting to a pdf file)
g. Calendar of games (more prominent position, user-friendly interface)

2. Re-organizing the layout of the website to be more user-friendly
a. Consolidating past information/archives into one page
b. Cater frontpage towards people familiar with IMs - current games going on, relevant announcements


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Selena Lee (section leaders: Reese Wynn and Greta Browne), Rebecca Dai (section leader: Jessica McCurdy)

## Do you have any questions of your own?

1. How should we split up work/how can we collaborate remotely on the project?
2. Do you think this project is suitable for three people to work on?
