Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Rebecca: I have written the code for application.py and the related html pages that allow the captains to update the college standings for two sports and two colleges as a sample.

Selena: I’ve looked into the google calendar API, which has thorough instructions for implementation, and how to create a photo slideshow for the website using JavaScript and CSS. I’ve also started to work through the current IMs website to figure out how to arrange it in a more accessible manner.

Amy: I’ve compared the similarities of what is required for the captains’ contact info table and related methods with its parallels in pset 8, and sketched out my TO DOs.


#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Rebecca: I haven’t written the html template that allows everyone to view the college standings. Haven’t completed the code for every college and every sport.

Selena: I haven’t written any code yet (still in the planning/research phase).

Amy: While I have the beginning building blocks from pset8’s distribution code, I haven’t written out much code specifically related to IMs yet.


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Rebecca: it is very repetitive to create forms and pages for all the sports and all the colleges. Not sure how to simplify the code. Also not sure if the code I have right now is the best way to update the standings.

Selena: Understanding the google calendar API instructions has been a little difficult.

Amy: I’m still in the process of understanding how to collaborate on GitHub and how to combine all three individual parts together.
